Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s

A simple solution is discussed in this(Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s (Simple Counting)) post.
Method 1 
 

    Approach:The problem is similar to our old post Segregate 0s and 1s in an array, and both of these problems are variation of famous Dutch national flag problem.
    The problem was posed with three colours, here `0′, `1′ and `2′. The array is divided into four sections: 
        a[1..Lo-1] zeroes (red)
        a[Lo..Mid-1] ones (white)
        a[Mid..Hi] unknown
        a[Hi+1..N] twos (blue)
        If the ith element is 0 then swap the element to the low range, thus shrinking the unknown range.
        Similarly, if the element is 1 then keep it as it is but shrink the unknown range.
        If the element is 2 then swap it with an element in high range.
    Algorithm: 
        Keep three indices low = 1, mid = 1 and high = N and there are four ranges, 1 to low (the range containing 0), low to mid (the range containing 1), mid to high (the range containing unknown elements) and high to N (the range containing 2).
        Traverse the array from start to end and mid is less than high. (Loop counter is i)
        If the element is 0 then swap the element with the element at index low and update low = low + 1 and mid = mid + 1
        If the element is 1 then update mid = mid + 1
        If the element is 2 then swap the element with the element at index high and update high = high – 1 and update i = i – 1. As the swapped element is not processed
        Print the output array.
    Dry Run: 
    Part way through the process, some red, white and blue elements are known and are in the “right” place. The section of unknown elements, a[Mid..Hi], is shrunk by examining a[Mid]:
     

    DNF1

    Examine a[Mid]. There are three possibilities: 
    a[Mid] is (0) red, (1) white or (2) blue. 
    Case (0) a[Mid] is red, swap a[Lo] and a[Mid]; Lo++; Mid++
     


    DNF2

    Case (1) a[Mid] is white, Mid++
     

    DNF3

    Case (2) a[Mid] is blue, swap a[Mid] and a[Hi]; Hi–
     

    DNF4

    Continue until Mid>Hi. 
     

     
    Implementation: 
     

// Java program to sort an array of 0, 1 and 2
import java.io.*;
 
class countzot {
 
    // Sort the input array, the array is assumed to
    // have values in {0, 1, 2}
    static void sort012(int a[], int arr_size)
    {
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = arr_size - 1;
        int mid = 0, temp = 0;
        while (mid <= hi) {
            switch (a[mid]) {
            case 0: {
                temp = a[lo];
                a[lo] = a[mid];
                a[mid] = temp;
                lo++;
                mid++;
                break;
            }
            case 1:
                mid++;
                break;
            case 2: {
                temp = a[mid];
                a[mid] = a[hi];
                a[hi] = temp;
                hi--;
                break;
            }
            }
        }
    }
 
    /* Utility function to print array arr[] */
    static void printArray(int arr[], int arr_size)
    {
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i < arr_size; i++)
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
        System.out.println("");
    }
 
    /*Driver function to check for above functions*/
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int arr[] = { 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1 };
        int arr_size = arr.length;
        sort012(arr, arr_size);
        System.out.println("Array after seggregation ");
        printArray(arr, arr_size);
    }
}

    Output:

 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 

     
    Complexity Analysis: 
        Time Complexity: O(n). 
        Only one traversal of the array is needed.
        Space Complexity: O(1). 
        No extra space is required.
        Approach: Count the number of 0s, 1s and 2s in the given array. Then store all the 0s in the beginning followed by all the 1s then all the 2s.
        Algorithm: 
            Keep three counter c0 to count 0s, c1 to count 1s and c2 to count 2s
            Traverse through the array and increase the count of c0 is the element is 0,increase the count of c1 is the element is 1 and increase the count of c2 is the element is 2
            Now again traverse the array and replace first c0 elements with 0, next c1 elements with 1 and next c2 elements with 2.

    Complexity Analysis: 
        Time Complexity: O(n). 
        Only two traversals of the array is needed.
        Space Complexity: O(1). 
        As no extra space is required.
